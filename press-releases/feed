<p>Today The PPL proudly announces partership with Eventbrite, the premier online self-service ticketing platform. Attendees will have a seamless registration experience from the moment of ticket purchase all the way to check-in at the front door of Packard Place next month during the days leading up to the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventbrite is excited to be partnering with The PPL to help journalists come together around the Convention. We know events of all types&#8211;from massive rallies to conferences to intimate fundraisers&#8211;are a great way for people to deepen their understanding of the issues that matter to them. Technology is facilitating meaningful civic engagement, and the bloggers gathering at The PPL are a great example of that power.&#8221; Says David Glasgow, Eventbrite&#8217;s Political Community Manager.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vUl1onARMzg" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Having Eventbrite join The PPL further solidifies our venue space as the hub for increasing civic discourse.&#8221; states cofounder Matt Tyndall, &#8220;The PPL&#8217;s credentials give access to national and local stage programming, coworking space, networking opportunities, power, wifi and more. Our visitors will gain easy access into our space and slip right in to enjoy the vibrant, bustling atmosphere Eventbrite is certainly contributing to through this partnership.&#8221; He continues, &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to be partnering our organizations; theirs focused on democratization of ticket sales and ours focused on democratization of media voice.&#8221;</p>
<div>The PPL is only a few blocks away from all convention activities and visiting media are encouraged to secure their credentials using The PPL&#8217;s Evenbrite registration link (<a href="http://dnc2012.eventbrite.com">http://dnc2012.eventbrite.com</a>) by August 20 when tickets raise from $80 to $99. They will raise again on September 1 to $120 and all are on a first-come, first served basis.</div>
<h4>About The PPL:</h4>
<p>The PPL is more than a centrally located building in Uptown Charlotte that will serve as the hub of activity for 1,000 plus independent voices attending the Democratic National Convention. The PPL is the result of a grassroots effort to organize an energetic workspace, combined with engaging programming, for a diverse, creative community of non-credentialed bloggers, journalists, photographers, artists, and activists who will collectively provide the voice of healthy, respectful political discourse for the Democratic National Convention September 3 through 6.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1265" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 622px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1265 " title="Charlotte, NC" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/1.jpeg" alt="Photo: Desiree Kane" width="612" height="612" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlotte, NC</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Democratic National Convention is less than a month away and as it draws near, news of progress and positive change is afoot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Charlotte-based project The PPL (pronounced “The People”)—one aimed at providing a platform, stage programming, coworking space and resources for the global unaccredited media producers in town for the convention—is partnering up with <a href="http://netrootsnation.com" target="_blank">Netroots Foundation</a>, a nonprofit that brings together online citizens across America, injects progressive voices into the national conversation and advances the values of justice, equality and community in our nation’s politics. It’s this kind of joint effort that exemplifies tangible momentum happening right now in North Carolina’s largest city.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qHP7ETSS0Ho" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through this partnership, both organizations will serve a single goal: to increase the level of discourse present in today’s political system through empowering new media makers of all sorts. Packard Place, the location of The PPL events in September, will house these resources, including a stage with programming aimed at connecting decision makers in Washington with the online progressive community.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The PPL’s main stage content is being organized around the four legacy items of the DNCC: healthy children/healthy families, youth employment and civic engagement,  building a broader, more inclusive society, and  energy/tech/sustainability. <a href="http://www.democracyforamerica.com/" target="_blank">Democracy for America</a> will also host a special broadcast studio that will be the hub for creating and distributing content about progressive strategy for 2012 and beyond. This content will be streamed at <a href="http://netrootsnation.org" target="_blank">NetrootsNation.org</a> and online, as well as shared with partner organizations around the country.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/POLwX_9jno0" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>The volunteer base is ramping up support for The PPL as well. <a href="http://www.queens.edu/Academics-and-Schools/Schools-and-Colleges/Knight-School-of-Communication.html" target="_blank">Queens University</a> is staffing a large majority of the volunteer positions and alongside them will be <a href="http://www.progressnc.org/" target="_blank">Progress NC</a>, an affiliate of <a href="http://http://www.progressnow.org/" target="_blank">Progress Now.</a></p>
<p>Netroots Foundation, which organizes the largest annual progressive conference Netroots Nation, was also a major partner in the successful Big Tent event at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, with more than 1,000 participants per day representing 200 blogs and dozens of organizations.</p>
