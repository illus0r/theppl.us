			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let’s get a little more specific.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://theppl.us/578/franks_pictures_003" rel="attachment wp-att-579"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-579" title="Frank's_pictures_003" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Franks_pictures_003-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="300" /></a>Name?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Frank Barrows.</p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte?</strong></p>
<p>43. Or since Richard Nixon&#8217;s first term in the White House.</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Advocate for journalism and journalists. Nationally published writer. Pulitzer-winning editor. Basketball follower.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve seen many different kinds of energy surface in Charlotte. But I think this will be the most pronounced and most visible show of political energy our town has ever witnessed.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I believe the two highest callings in journalism are public service and ensuring that the next generation of the profession&#8217;s practitioners are superior to the current one. The PPL can have an impact on both fronts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let’s get a little more specific.</em></p>
<p><em>So who are these PPL, anyway? In this five-question series, you’ll get the quick-and-dirty on the folks making this thing happen.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://theppl.us/561/joannelaughing_small-2" rel="attachment wp-att-563"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-563" title="joannelaughing_small" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/joannelaughing_small1-235x300.jpg" alt="" width="235" height="300" /></a>Name?</strong></p>
<p>Joanne Spataro.</p>
<p><strong>Years in CLT?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve lived in Charlotte since 1994. My parents are native New Yorkers and we moved to the South when I was a baby. I am a blend of Northern and Southern culture, which puts me in good company with newcomers and lifelong Charlotteans alike. To put it in food terms, a bagel with cream cheese is my first choice, but I can’t resist a Bojangles biscuit!</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p>I’m a freelance writer, editor and cultural arts buff. My articles appear every Thursday in the ArtsAlive section of <em>The Charlotte Observer</em>. I write about artists, art supporters, and everything in between. As a contributor to <em>Creative Loafing</em>, I cover fantastic events, including the 2012 Human Rights Campaign Gala. I recently appeared on <em>The Paul Brown Show</em> to talk about the Charlotte art scene and my journalism career. I also have a news/entertainment blog called <em>Look It’s Joanne</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
<p>I can’t wait to see elected officials and delegates enjoying our city. I hope to see them eating in our local restaurants and taking in the cultural scene. Since it is “The People’s Convention,” I hope they will feel free to reach out to the independent media. Of course, I will keep my eyes peeled for famous faces and say hello. I also have orders from my mom, who’s a big fan of MSNBC’s <em>Hardball</em>, to chat up host Chris Matthews.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p>I believe in how The PPL empowers the independent media community. As part of this progressive team, I want to drill down to the core issues of the DNC. I&#8217;m using my writing and editorial skills to provide our audience with excellent, reliable, and entertaining content. I love The PPL&#8217;s team environment and how our varied talents combine to achieve the same goal.</p>
<p>I’m hoping viewers will rethink what it means to be an independent writer/artist. Many people see blogging as a solitary activity done in the vacuum of the internet. We are breaking that stereotype by putting diverse bloggers together in one room. Making connections in real space is crucial to continued forward-thinking and sharing new ideas.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let’s get a little more specific.</em></p>
<p><em>So who are these PPL, anyway? In this five-question series, you’ll get the quick-and-dirty on the folks making this thing happen.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://theppl.us/556/matt" rel="attachment wp-att-557"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-557" title="matt" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/matt-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" /></a>Name?</strong></p>
<p>Matthew Tyndall.</p>
<p><strong>Years in CLT?</strong></p>
<p>Been here since 2005, before that I live in Fayetteville.</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p>Started <a href="http://cltblog.com" target="_blank">CLT Blog</a> in 2008 and founded <a href="http://pricelessmisc.com/" target="_blank">Priceless Miscellaneous</a> (a local creative studio).</p>
<div>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
</div>
<p>I love that Charlotte will get its chance to be at the forefront of national media and that we&#8217;ll get to play an active role in the national discourse. This is going to be a year where the individual voice will play a big part in deciding who our next President will be, and it is great that we will be part of that movement.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p>We are entering an era we the average citizen is the mass media. The PPL will be the best example to date of bloggers and independent media &#8212; people like you and me &#8212; being able to tell their story, and that story being broadcast to the masses. Being that nexus of information and helping others tell their story is what makes me most excited about the PPL.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let’s get a little more specific.</em></p>
<p><em>So who are these PPL, anyway? In this five-question series, you’ll get the quick-and-dirty on the folks making this thing happen.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://theppl.us/523/michaeljsolender-headshot1-202x300" rel="attachment wp-att-524"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-524" title="MichaelJSolender-Headshot1-202x300" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MichaelJSolender-Headshot1-202x300.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" /></a>Name?</strong></p>
<p>Michael J. Solender.</p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte?</strong></p>
<p>I moved to Charlotte in 2001. Prior to that I lived in Winston Salem (three and a half years), Richmond (three years), Los Angeles (10 years), Washington, D.C. (one year), Melbourne, Fla. (three years) and Minneapolis, MN (23 years). I like to move – NOT!</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p>I am an independent journalist and the City Life Editor for <a href="http://www.charlotteviewpoint.org" target="_blank">Charlotte Viewpoint</a>. I wish I were golfing right now.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
<p>People from across the country catching a glimpse of Charlotte and what we have going on here. It will be fun to show off a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p>I am excited to help establish a platform where non-mainstream grass roots citizenry can share the pulpit, express themselves and be part of the process of vetting ideas. America is truly a model for democracy for the rest of the world – that we can all play a part is a pretty heady notion. Not everyone is divisive. It will be tremendous to illustrate the fact that there will be an informed exchange, and the PPL will play a large role in creating that platform.</p>
<p>To be part of the arts community that is rallying around engaging ideas to showcase local work is also exciting and fun. The talent associated with the PPL is staggering, and the energy being created is great fun and inspirational.</p>

<p><em>So who are these PPL, anyway? In this five-question series, you’ll get the quick-and-dirty on the folks making this thing happen.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://theppl.us/blog/444/2012-04-30-18-24-34" rel="attachment wp-att-2987"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2987 alignleft" title="2012-04-30 18.24.34" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012-04-30-18.24.34-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Name?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Desiree Kane.</p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte?</strong></p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p>Being an unofficial Charlotte cheerleader &#8212; and I&#8217;ve been to space! Okay, not literally. But I am part of the #NASATweetup press corps, which means when the last shuttle (ever) launched, I was there at the countdown clock! I&#8217;m recently back from an amazing around-the-world trip that included visits to: Doha, Qatar (for TEDxSummit), Nevada/Utah/Arizona, Hong Kong (for TEDxLionRock) and Macau!</p>
<p>Back in 2010, I orchestrated the #DNC2012 hashtag party on<a href="http://cltblog.com" target="_blank"> CLT Blog</a> to attract the touring committee to our fair city, too. More formally, I am a Guilford College grad, serve on the Steering Committee of TEDxCharlotte, sit on the Knight Foundation Community Advisory board, am a <a href="http://www.charlotteviewpoint.org" target="_blank">Charlotte Viewpoint</a> opinion columnist, sit on the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s entrepreneur advisory board, and am Creative Loafing Charlotte&#8217;s resident travel and tech blogger at <a href="http://clclt.com/blogs/wayfaringtechnomad">The Wayfaring Tech Nomad.</a></p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I am looking forward to it all, especially the out-of-town visitors. I have never met a stranger and love meeting new people! The chance to show off Charlotte to these folks is just tremendous and that is SO EXCITING!!!!</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I have been to a lot of different countries and have seen that there are so many ways to live in this world. I firmly believe in paying it forward, and I feel that providing access to information, people and services that are otherwise unavailable to the unaccredited masses pays the favor forward to our society. New and traditional media with apolitical, multipartisan integrity is at the very core of an informed, engaged community we can all feel good about being a part of.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let’s get a little more specific.</em></p>

<p>Justin Ruckman.</p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte?</strong></p>
<p>Born and raised, minus some college.</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p>Started <a href="http://cltblog.com" target="_blank">CLT Blog</a> four years ago, which now has its own weekly TV show on WTVI</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
<p>I grew up here, so I love opportunities like this to see our city through the eyes of people who didn&#8217;t. Not to mention I can&#8217;t wait to hang out with all the bloggers &#8212; it&#8217;s gonna be a mini SXSW!</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p>This project, and online media at large, represent some of my generation&#8217;s most important values: community, transparency, diversity and the application of technology for social good. I want to see more people talking about government, and fewer people talking about politics.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Who is behind the PPL? In today's installment of the Five Questions, meet investigative journalist Rhiannon Fionn-Bowman.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let’s get a little more specific.</em></p>
<p><em>So who are these PPL, anyway? In this five-question series, you’ll get the quick-and-dirty on the folks making this thing happen.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://theppl.us/395/rhi" rel="attachment wp-att-396"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-396" title="rhi" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rhi-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Name?</strong></p>
<p>Rhiannon Fionn-Bowman</p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve lived in Charlotte since 2005. Before that I lived in Atlanta, Ga., and before that Montgomery, Ala.</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p>Independent investigative journalist focused on Charlotte’s coal ash issues. I also covered the Jinwright tax evasion trial for <a href="http://Qcitymetro.com" target="_blank">Qcitymetro.com</a> and Occupy Charlotte for <a href="http://clclt.com/" target="_blank">Creative Loafing</a>. I have also written on all of those topics for <em><a href="http://www.charlottemagazine.com/" target="_blank">Charlotte</a></em> magazine.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> I’ll be hosting a forum on coal ash for The PPL that will, if all goes as planned, bring in leaders from all sides of the issue and allow time for the community to ask questions. Coal ash is America’s second-largest waste stream and is currently unregulated at the federal level. North Carolina has more high-hazard coal ash ponds than any other state, two of which drain into Charlotte’s main drinking water reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p>Because I believe the people’s voice is just as important as the voices from government and business.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let&#8217;s get a little more specific. </em></p>
<p><em>So who are these PPL, anyway? In this five-question series, you&#8217;ll get the quick-and-dirty on the folks making this thing happen.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://theppl.us/382/brighton" rel="attachment wp-att-383"><img class="size-medium wp-image-383 alignleft" title="brighton" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/brighton-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name?</strong></p>
<p>Lila Allen.</p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>All 24 so far, though technically I was in Davidson for four. That photo up there obviously isn&#8217;t Charlotte; that&#8217;s Brighton, UK.</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame?</strong></p>
<p>Most people know me either through my writing (mostly at <a href="http://www.charlotteviewpoint.org" target="_blank">Charlotte Viewpoint</a> or <a href="http://altclt.com" target="_blank">ALT CLT</a>) or through my affiliation with art institutions in town. I&#8217;ve worked at the Mint, McColl Center, the Bechtler, and interned at Center of the Earth Gallery.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I&#8217;m excited to see what local artists and curators are going to come up with for the convention &#8212; I&#8217;m ready for stuff to get weird. Since the whole country will be looking at Charlotte, I think it will give many people the incentive they need to really put themselves out there and get active and creative.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Having grown up here, Charlotte is important to me. We&#8217;re still learning who we are as a city, and the cool thing about that is that if you want to, you can help shape it. I see the PPL as being a part of that. Getting awesome, talented and diverse people together to support indie media? Count me in. The relationships and momentum we&#8217;re building now until the DNC will continue to serve us well after the out-of-towners have left.</p>
<p>My role at the PPL is to help cover local arts and culture, which is something I find fun anyway. If I can put my thoughts together in a way that helps inform and entertain other people, even better.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m also the lady posting these nifty interviews. See you tomorrow!)</p>
