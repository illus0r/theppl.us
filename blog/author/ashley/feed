<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC</strong>: The<br />
DNC is coming up this September and I am looking forward to meeting all of the people. There will be such a diverse group of people in Charlotte during that time which I hope to network with. The DNC will let me apply my skills to make a difference in the world of politics.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://theppl.us/jeffwilber/photo-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-829"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-829" title="Jeff Wilber" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/photo1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Jeffrey Wilber (Jeff)</p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte</strong>: About a month, but I have visited family here my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame:</strong> Co-founded a website called The Kitty Litter, an online forum for Western Carolina Students to voice honest opinions without being ignored  (In the first two hours we drove 4,000 hits to the site).  I am also working on a children’s book about boogers.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC:</strong> The opportunity to network with political figures, and nationally recognized members of the press.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL:</strong> I knew that I could contribute to this effort. I use a quote from comedian Steve Martin to explain why I want to write, he says, “Some people have a way with words, others, just don’t seem to have a way with words I suppose.”  I know that I have a way with words, and my effort was best suited for the PPL.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.2309950685594231"><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The PPL is diverse, by definition: we are bloggers, photojournalists, artists and entrepreneurs of varied ages and backgrounds committed to supporting independent media during the 2012 DNC. But let’s get a little more specific.</em></p>
<p><em>So who are these PPL, anyway? In this five-question series, you’ll get the quick-and-dirty on the folks making this thing happen.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="http://theppl.us/jillbjers/jill/" rel="attachment wp-att-842"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-842" title="Jill" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Jill-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Name</strong>: Jill Bjers<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Years in Charlotte:</strong> I’m originally from Salt Lake City, I moved to Charlotte almost a year and a half ago. I love it back home but always had this strange mix of leaving home (Salt Lake City) to come home (Charlotte) from the first time I visited.</p>
<p><strong>Claim to fame</strong>: That depends on who you ask, if you ask my son he will gleefully tell you about how I started chatting up band members of his favorite band, introduced him to them, then we all went to waffles together after the show. If you ask my fiance he will tell you about how I was kidnapped by Alice Cooper and taken to Vegas for dinner. But mostly, I’m an over-educated travel junkie that manages to get paid for writing anything that pops in my mind and stumbled into a job with free flights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I played a small part in organizing culture and hospitality for the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake. I have organized and participated in many community events and initiatives.  Currently I’m one of BarCamp Charlotte’s organizers and a civic volunteer throughout Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC</strong>: It is hard to narrow that one down. I love meeting new people and getting the chance to hear what they are passionate about.  I’m excited to see Charlotte in the spotlight and have every confidence the rest of the country will see what I did the first time I came here. And, also, everything!</p>
<p><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL</strong>: I’m a firm advocate of how community, people and accessibility of information can bring about social good.  The PPL is working to bring all of those aspects to the DNC, with the tools to empower the independent media. I’m excited to see a group of individual bloggers show the world they truly are a community and have their voices heard.  I sincerely believe this convention can change the way the political parties view independent media and reshapes the conversation.<strong><br />

<div></div>
</p>
<div><strong>Name</strong>: Ashley Bowen (<a href="http://youtu.be/jm-TDZ7wPCw">watch her video</a>)</div>
<div></div>
</p>
<div><strong>Years in Charlotte</strong>: 22 (all my life)</div>
<div></div>
</p>
<div><strong>Claim to fame</strong>: Got to work with the Neighborhood Theatre for 6 months. Learned a lot about the PR/Marketing field and got to see some great shows! I love NoDa so that internship was not only great experience but fun as well!</div>
<div></div>
</p>
<div><strong>What are you looking forward to at the DNC</strong>: I want to meet as many people as possible. I have never been a part of something as large scale as the DNC. Also, Charlotte is my hometown so I look forward to seeing the recognition this city has deserved for a long time. After Amendment One was passed people have looked down on North Carolina and Charlotte (even though was denied in Mecklenburg County.) I hope the DNC will change the negative perception of this great city!</div>
<div></div>
</p>
<div><strong>Why are you a part of the PPL</strong>: I love this city and I hope to showcase the diversity of this city through this internship. Also, I want the community to feel more involved in the DNC. I don’t want them to think the DNC is just going to cause traffic and delays. I want them to see the economic and societal benefits the DNC will bring to the city as a whole.</div>

<p style="text-align: left;">We want to give a big shoutout to Queens University for donating so many volunteers during the DNC. The Knight School of Communication will shut down during the DNC leaving the doors wide open for students to donate their time. This allows students to gain real world experience without jeapordizing their studies. We, The PPL, are excited to work with more students from Queens. We have had the opportunity to work with Queens&#8217; students before and have surely noticed their innovative education.</p>
