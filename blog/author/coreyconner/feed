			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Untitled.jpg" alt="" title="Untitled" width="586" height="171" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1444" /></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/youtube-gets-an-investigative-news-channel/">Techcrunch recently covered The Center for Investigative Reporting&#8217;s (CIR) new YouTube channel, The I Files.</a> YouTube is helping to launch the channel that will aggregate investigative video reports from various news organizations, including the BBC and Al Jazeera.</p>
<blockquote><p>To justify the partnership with a website normally associated with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8XAlSp838Y" target="_blank">skateboarding dogs</a>, the I Files team cites <a href="http://www.journalism.org/analysis_report/youtube_news" target="_blank">recent evidence</a> that user-generated content on YouTube is a growing source of serious news for the average citizen. “That’s our assignment at The I Files,” writes Stephen Talbot for the Bay Citizen, “to be timely and relevant, to provide an outlet for a citizen journalist who captures an incredible moment on camera, but above all to dig deeper and to present well-reported and engaging stories that offer real information and insights.”</p>
<p>The YouTube project is part of the Knight Foundation’s <a href="http://www.knightdigitalmediacenter.org/news_blog/comments/20110610_knight_foundation_responds_to_fcc_info_needs_of_communities_report/" target="_blank">push</a> for philanthropically-funded local investigative journalism, which has been hit especially hard by the financial downturn of traditional media. Last year, the FCC released a report on the decline of journalists covering local politics, and speculated about the possible corruption and negligence going unnoticed. YouTube could potentially offset this problem with user-generated content and by incentivizing the CIR’s national partners, such as the BBC, with some added viewership.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/baybridges/cir-launches-youtubes-first-news-channel/">The Bay Citizen, a CIR organization, had this to say about the new YouTube channel:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The I Files has the potential to create significant impact by engaging new audiences in the value of investigative reporting by exposing what is happening in our world. These connections will help support a network for and give a platform to lesser-known and less-resourced video journalists.</p>
<p>We will reach out to journalism schools across the country and ask students to submit videos for The I Files Futures Award contest. The top 10 videos will be selected by a panel led by CIR Senior Producer Steve Talbot and showcased on The I Files. Viewers will then select the first-place winner. More on this coming soon.</p>
<p>The I Files will be at the forefront as new models emerge for how journalism is produced, consumed and shared.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut3URdEzlKQ&amp;list=PL418BC1BDA10B4706&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp">Here&#8217;s a link to one of the first videos featured on The I Files, The Hidden Cost of Hamburgers.</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1414" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 602px"><a href="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7210141434_3cfd0741ab_k2.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-1414    " title="Charlotte From the Duke Energy Center" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7210141434_3cfd0741ab_k2.jpeg" alt="Charlotte from the Duke Energy Center" width="592" height="371" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Courtesy of Willamor Media</p></div>
<p>From Sunday, Sept. 2, through Friday, Sept. 7, security for the DNC will limit pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the uptown area. <a href="http://redf.com/packard/" target="_blank">Packard Place</a>, The PPL&#8217;s home at Church and 3rd Street will remain fully accessible despite its location near the convention&#8217;s main venues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/packard-map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1395" title="Packard Place in relation to convention activities" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/packard-map.jpg" alt="Packard Place in relation to convention activities" width="446" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/08/08/3439951/dnc-2012-security-plan-roads-closed.html" target="_blank">According to the Charlotte Observer, uptown businesses, along with the city, are working to ensure traffic disruptions have a minimal impact on day-to-day operations.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Folks that want to stay open will be able to stay open,” said Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx, a Democrat.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>While Tryon Street will be open during much of the DNC, it will become a one-way street for northbound traffic between Stonewall and 12th streets from 6 a.m. Tuesday, Sept. 4, through Wednesday, Sept. 5. Most east-west streets crossing it in uptown will be closed.</p>
<p>That could make it difficult for commuters to access large parking garages used by office workers in city office buildings.</p>
<p>At Bank of America, which employs about 15,000 people in Charlotte, each department has made plans to keep business activities running, spokesman Scott Silvestri said. That includes encouraging employees to work from a mix of uptown offices, alternate bank facilities and their homes, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>A one block area around Time Warner Cable Arena will only be accessible to those with credentials. People working uptown, outside of the areas requiring credentials, may have to deal with security checkpoints to reach limited-access areas.</p>
<p>However, people may not be able to park in their typical parking garage.</p>
<p>Potentially the biggest traffic disruption from the convention will come at the end of the week. The John Belk Freeway will be closed on Thursday near the Bank of America Stadium in preparation for President Obama&#8217;s acceptance speech that night.</p>
<p>Following Obama&#8217;s speech and the conclusion of the convention, locals can expect a return to normalcy after 9AM on Friday morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="Read more here: http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/08/08/3439951/dnc-2012-security-plan-roads-closed.html">The Charlotte Observer has more on traffic and pedestrian disruption during the DNC.</a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Convention Activities</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although the convention does not officially begin until the 3rd, other events will disrupt traffic starting on Sept. 2. The <a href="http://wallstsouth.org/march-on-wall-street-south/" target="_blank">Coalition to March on Wall Street South</a> will march in their &#8220;accessible, family-friendly protest&#8221;, prompting road closures along the route.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sundaymarch-route2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1407   aligncenter" title="March on Wall Street South march route" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Sundaymarch-route2.jpg" alt="March on Wall Street South march route" width="477" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>The group will gather at Frazier Park and march pass Bank of America&#8217;s headquarters, Wells-Fargo&#8217;s east coast headquarters, and the Duke Energy Center.</p>
<p>On Monday, the DNC will kick off the convention with <a href="http://charlottein2012.com/carolinafest2012/" target="_blank">CarolinaFest</a>, the uptown event originally planned for Charlotte Motor Speedway. CarolinaFest will take place along Tryon Street between Trade and Stonewall, making that section of Tryon inaccessible to vehicles. Tryon will remain open to pedestrians throughout the week.</p>
<p><a href="http://charlottein2012.com/carolinafest2012/" target="_blank">According to the organizing committee</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>CarolinaFest is a family friendly celebration that will bring more Americans than ever before directly into the heart of convention activity, including an opportunity to witness delegate caucus meetings that will occur in Uptown. The free event will feature interactive expositions, family oriented activities, live music, and speakers.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seth Flaxman, co-founder of TurboVote, believes the voting process is still stuck in the 20th century. <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/01/turbovote/">According to an interview with Mashable, he hopes to turn his product into the &#8220;Netflix of voting&#8221; by streamlining voter registration and mail-in voting.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Seth Flaxman, 27, co-founded TurboVote after getting frustrated at the process of voting by mail while he was studying at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Like many other digital entrepreneurs, Flaxman built TurboVote to solve his own problem. He believes the voting process is antiquated and ripe for digital disruption.</p>
<p>“When you want to do anything else, you start online — except for voting,” said Flaxman. “I think the future of voting is seamless mail-in voting. The ballot will come automatically in the mail, you’ll get reminder texts, you open your laptop and look at the ballot, do your research and mail it in.”</p>
<p>The company started with a focus on vote by mail, but later shifted to include voter registration as well.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make vote by mail really easy,” said Flaxman. “We saw that as the way to modernize the voting system and then thought ‘oh, we also have to do voter registration.’ For us it’s about everything. We want to be a single place where users can sign up and then only have to worry about who they’re going to vote for.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://turbovote.org">Users can sign-up for the service at turbovote.org.</a> People who are already registered to vote can still register for the service to vote through the mail or receive reminders for upcoming elections.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_930" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 586px"><a href="http://theppl.us/an-unrepresentative-congress/2044748271_b809bdf62c_z/" rel="attachment wp-att-930"><img class=" wp-image-930 " title="US Capitol Building" src="http://theppl.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2044748271_b809bdf62c_z.jpeg" alt="US Capitol Building" width="576" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Courtesy of Andrew Malone</p></div>
<p>Despite the United States’ history as a representative democracy, the current congress isn’t much like its people.</p>
<p>Cord Jefferson, with <a href="http://good.is">Good</a>, recently looked at <a href="http://www.good.is/post/infographic-what-congress-would-look-like-if-it-really-represented-america/">what congress would look like if it really represented America</a>.</p>
<p>Almost 100 years after<a href="http://womenincongress.house.gov/"> the first woman was elected to congress</a>, there are only 91 women serving compared to 448 men.</p>
<p>Racial diversity is also lacking. Caucasians are over-represented, while every other race is under-represented.</p>
<p>As Jefferson pointed out, even economically, Congress doesn&#8217;t represent the norm.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our senators and representatives are also wholly different from most Americans in terms of wealth. We&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.good.is/post/your-new-congressmen-are-richer-than-pretty-much-everyone-you-know/">said this before</a>, but it bears repeating: The average American&#8217;s net worth is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/24/pf/financial_crisis_outcome/">$96,000</a>. But the average Senator&#8217;s net worth? <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/averages.php">$13.4 million</a>. For House members that sum drops to &#8220;just&#8221; $5 million.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-11-15/congress-wealthy-1/51216626/1">57 members of Congress are part of the 1%</a>, but will a candidate&#8217;s personal finances trump the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">all important issues of jobs and the economy at large</a>?</p>
<p>Not in the opinion of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/why-people-hate-congress-in-one-chart/2011/12/28/gIQA1IyUMP_blog.html">Washington Post columnist Aaron Blake</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>So should we expect Americans to start voting out the wealthy and voting in the middle class? Not exactly.</p>
<p>The realities of campaigning make it a rich person’s enterprise. Candidates often have to have enough wealth so that they can leave their jobs to campaign full-time, and it always helps to be able to put millions of your own money into a campaign.</p>
<p>But the fact that people are learning that their Congress is getting richer, even in tough economic times, bodes ill for whatever hope legislators had for returning to the good graces of the American public.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite this, occupy-inspired candidates, such as<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/06/george-martinez-occupy-wall-street-congress-ny1-debate.html"> George Martinez in New York&#8217;s 7th congressional district</a>, are struggling to move past protest movements and into electoral politics.</p>
<p>So, while Congress&#8217;s personal wealth may not inspire much voter enthusiasm, it could help sustain the values of a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-the-end-of-occupy-wall-street-20120610,0,7439790.story">struggling Occupy movement</a>. As the rich become richer and the rest, poorer, the discrepancies between Congress and the people may become exasperated as they move to tackle issues such as <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2012/0425/Student-loans-Will-Congress-s-remedy-favor-middle-class-over-poor">$1 trillion in student loan debt</a> heading into election season.</p>
<p>Historically, Congress hasn&#8217;t been an edifice of diversity, and there is no indication that drastic change is around the corner. However,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/opinion/krugman-states-of-depression.html"> a prolonged state of depression</a> might cause voters to look for a more accurate representation of themselves.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s no need to stand on the street and hail a cab for the DNCC Spring Media Walkthrough. The DNCC and <a href="http://uber.com">Uber</a>, an app-driven private car service, have partnered up to offer transportation including a free first ride, up to $40.</p>
<p><a href="http://uber.com"> Uber</a>, available in the iPhone and Android app stores handles calling a driver, and  keeps the user&#8217;s credit card on file to take care of the tip.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the information on how to sign up:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>To take your first ride, follow the steps below:</strong></p>
<ol start="1">
<li>~5-10 minutes before you are ready to travel, open the app and move the pin to your location.  You can also text your address to 827-222 (e.g. 501 South College Street, Charlotte, NC 28202) or input it directly at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://m.uber.com/" target="_blank">m.uber.com</a></span>.</li>
<li>Submit your request and watch as your private driver is dispatched.  You will receive an estimate of when your driver will arrive and a text message when your driver is arriving.</li>
</ol>
